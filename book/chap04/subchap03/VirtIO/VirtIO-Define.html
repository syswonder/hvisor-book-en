<p>Note that this document mainly introduces how Virtio is implemented in hvisor. For detailed usage tutorials, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/syswonder/hvisor-tool?tab=readme-ov-file#readme">hvisor-tool-README</a>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-virtio"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-virtio">Introduction to Virtio</a></h2>
<p>Virtio, proposed by Rusty Russell in 2008, is a device virtualization standard aimed at improving device performance and unifying various semi-virtual device solutions. Currently, Virtio includes over a dozen peripherals such as disks, network cards, consoles, GPUs, etc., and many operating systems including Linux have implemented front-end drivers for various Virtio devices. Therefore, virtual machine monitors only need to implement Virtio backend devices to directly allow virtual machines that have implemented Virtio drivers, such as Linux, to use Virtio devices.</p>
<p>The Virtio protocol defines a set of driver interfaces for semi-virtual IO devices, specifying that the operating system of the virtual machine needs to implement front-end drivers, and the Hypervisor needs to implement backend devices. The virtual machine and Hypervisor communicate and interact through the data plane interface and control plane interface.</p>
<h3 id="data-plane-interface"><a class="header" href="#data-plane-interface">Data Plane Interface</a></h3>
<p>The data plane interface refers to the method of IO data transfer between the driver and the device. For Virtio, the data plane interface refers to a shared memory Virtqueue between the driver and the device. Virtqueue is an important data structure in the Virtio protocol, representing the mechanism and abstract representation of batch data transfer for Virtio devices, used for various data transfer operations between the driver and the device. Virtqueue consists of three main components: descriptor table, available ring, and used ring, which function as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Descriptor Table: An array of descriptors. Each descriptor contains four fields: addr, len, flag, next. Descriptors can represent the address (addr), size (len), and attributes (flag) of a memory buffer, which may contain IO request commands or data (filled by the Virtio driver) or the results after the completion of IO requests (filled by the Virtio device). Descriptors can be linked into a descriptor chain by the next field as needed, with one descriptor chain representing a complete IO request or result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Available Ring: A circular queue, where each element represents the index of an IO request issued by the Virtio driver in the descriptor table, i.e., each element points to the starting descriptor of a descriptor chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Used Ring: A circular queue, where each element represents the index of the IO result written by the Virtio device after completing the IO request in the descriptor table.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these three data structures, the commands, data, and results of IO data transfer requests between the driver and the device can be fully described. The Virtio driver is responsible for allocating the memory area where the Virtqueue is located and writing its address into the corresponding MMIO control registers to inform the Virtio device. This way, the device can obtain the addresses of the three and perform IO transfers with the driver through the Virtqueue.</p>
<h3 id="control-plane-interface"><a class="header" href="#control-plane-interface">Control Plane Interface</a></h3>
<p>The control plane interface refers to the way the driver discovers, configures, and manages the device. In hvisor, the control plane interface of Virtio mainly refers to the MMIO registers based on memory mapping. The operating system first detects MMIO-based Virtio devices through the device tree and negotiates, configures, and notifies the device by reading and writing these memory-mapped control registers. Some of the more important registers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>QueueSel: Used to select the current Virtqueue being operated. A device may contain multiple Virtqueues, and the driver indicates which queue it is operating by writing this register.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QueueDescLow, QueueDescHigh: Used to indicate the intermediate physical address IPA of the descriptor table. The driver writes these two 32-bit registers to inform the device of the 64-bit physical address of the descriptor table, used to establish shared memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QueueDriverLow, QueueDriverHigh: Used to indicate the intermediate physical address IPA of the available ring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QueueDeviceLow, QueueDeviceHigh: Used to indicate the intermediate physical address IPA of the used ring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QueueNotify: When the driver writes this register, it indicates that there are new IO requests in the Virtqueue that need to be processed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the control registers, the MMIO memory area of each device also contains a device configuration space. For disk devices, the configuration space indicates the disk capacity and block size; for network devices, the configuration space indicates the device's MAC address and connection status. For console devices, the configuration space provides console size information.</p>
<p>For the MMIO memory area of Virtio devices, the Hypervisor does not map the second-stage address translation for the virtual machine. When the driver reads and writes this area, a page fault exception will occur, causing a VM Exit into the Hypervisor. The Hypervisor can determine the register accessed by the driver based on the access address that caused the page fault and take appropriate action, such as notifying the device to perform IO operations. After processing, the Hypervisor returns to the virtual machine through VM Entry.</p>
<h3 id="io-process-of-virtio-devices"><a class="header" href="#io-process-of-virtio-devices">IO Process of Virtio Devices</a></h3>
<p>The process from when a user process running on a virtual machine initiates an IO operation to when it obtains the IO result can be roughly divided into the following four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user process initiates an IO operation, and the Virtio driver in the operating system kernel receives the IO operation command, writes it into the Virtqueue, and writes to the QueueNotify register to notify the Virtio device.</li>
<li>After receiving the notification, the device parses the available ring and descriptor table, obtains the specific IO request and buffer address, and performs the actual IO operation.</li>
<li>After completing the IO operation, the device writes the result into the used ring. If the driver program uses the polling method to wait for the IO result in the used ring, the driver can immediately receive the result information; otherwise, it needs to notify the driver program through an interrupt.</li>
<li>The driver program obtains the IO result from the used ring and returns it to the user process.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="design-and-implementation-of-virtio-backend-mechanism"><a class="header" href="#design-and-implementation-of-virtio-backend-mechanism">Design and Implementation of Virtio Backend Mechanism</a></h2>
<p>Virtio devices in hvisor follow the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.2/virtio-v1.2.pdf">Virtio v1.2</a> protocol for design and implementation. To maintain good device performance while ensuring the lightness of hvisor, two design points of the Virtio backend are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adopting a microkernel design philosophy, moving the implementation of Virtio devices from the Hypervisor layer to the management virtual machine user space. The management virtual machine runs the Linux operating system, known as Root Linux. Physical devices such as disks and network cards are passed through to Root Linux, while Virtio devices serve as daemons on Root Linux, providing device emulation for other virtual machines (Non Root Linux). This ensures the lightness of the Hypervisor layer, facilitating formal verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Virtio driver programs located on other virtual machines and the Virtio devices on Root Linux interact directly through shared memory. The shared memory area stores interaction information, known as the communication springboard, and adopts a producer-consumer model, shared by the Virtio device backend and Hypervisor. This reduces the interaction overhead between the driver and the device, enhancing the device's performance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the above two design points, the implementation of the Virtio backend device will be divided into three parts: communication springboard, Virtio daemon, and kernel service module:</p>
<h3 id="communication-springboard"><a class="header" href="#communication-springboard">Communication Springboard</a></h3>
<p>To achieve efficient interaction between drivers and devices distributed across different virtual machines, this document designs a communication springboard as a bridge for passing control plane interaction information between the driver and the device. It is essentially a shared memory area containing two circular queues: the request submission queue and the request result queue, which store interaction requests issued by the driver and results returned by the device, respectively. Both queues are located in the memory area shared by the Hypervisor and the Virtio daemon and adopt a producer-consumer model. The Hypervisor acts as the producer of the request submission queue and the consumer of the request result queue, while the Virtio daemon acts as the consumer of the request submission queue and the producer of the request result queue. This facilitates the transfer of Virtio control plane interaction information between Root Linux and other virtual machines. It should be noted that the request submission queue and the request result queue are not the same as the Virtqueue. The Virtqueue is the data plane interface between the driver and the device, used for data transfer and essentially containing information about the data buffer's address and structure. The communication springboard, on the other hand, is used for control plane interaction and communication between the driver and the device.</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication Springboard Structure</li>
</ul>
<p>The communication springboard is represented by the virtio_bridge structure, where req_list is the request submission queue, and res_list and cfg_values together form the request result queue. The device_req structure represents interaction requests sent by the driver to the device, and the device_res structure represents interrupt information to be injected by the device to notify the virtual machine driver program that the IO operation is complete.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// Communication springboard structure:
struct virtio_bridge {
    __u32 req_front;
    __u32 req_rear;
    __u32 res_front;

    // Request submission queue

</code></pre>
<h4 id="request-submission-queue"><a class="header" href="#request-submission-queue">Request Submission Queue</a></h4>
<p>The request submission queue is used for the driver to send control plane interaction requests to the device. When the driver reads and writes the MMIO memory area of the Virtio device, since the Hypervisor does not perform second-stage address mapping for this memory area in advance, the CPU executing the driver program will receive a page fault exception and fall into the Hypervisor. The Hypervisor will combine the current CPU number, page fault address, address width, value to be written (ignored if it is a read), virtual machine ID, and whether it is a write operation into a structure called device_req and add it to the request submission queue req_list. At this point, the Virtio daemon monitoring the request submission queue will retrieve the request for processing.</p>
<p>To facilitate communication between the Virtio daemon and the Hypervisor based on shared memory, the request submission queue req_list is implemented as a circular queue. The head index req_front is updated only by the Virtio process after retrieving the request, and the tail index req_rear is updated only by the Hypervisor after adding the request. If the head and tail indexes are equal, the queue is empty; if the tail index plus one modulo the queue size equals the head index, the queue is full, and the driver needs to block in place when adding requests, waiting for the queue to become available. To ensure that the Hypervisor and Virtio process have real-time observation and mutual exclusion access to shared memory, the Hypervisor needs to perform a write memory barrier after adding a request to the queue, then update the tail index, ensuring that the Virtio process correctly retrieves the request in the queue when observing the tail index update. After the Virtio daemon retrieves a request from the queue, it needs to perform a write memory barrier to ensure that the Hypervisor can immediately observe the head index update. This producer-consumer model and circular queue method, combined with necessary memory barriers, solve the mutual exclusion problem of shared memory under different privilege levels. Since multiple virtual machines may have multiple CPUs adding requests to the request submission queue simultaneously, CPUs need to acquire a mutex lock first before operating the request submission queue. In contrast, only the main thread of the Virtio daemon operates the request submission queue, so no locking is required. This solves the mutual exclusion problem of shared memory under the same privilege level.</p>
<h4 id="request-result-queue"><a class="header" href="#request-result-queue">Request Result Queue</a></h4>
<p>After the Virtio daemon completes the processing of a request, it will put the related information into the request result queue and notify the driver program. To improve communication efficiency, based on the classification of Virtio interaction information, the request result queue is divided into two sub-queues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Plane Result Sub-queue</li>
</ul>
<p>The data plane result queue, represented by the res_list structure, is used to store interrupt information. When the driver program writes to the Queue Notify register of the device memory area, it indicates that there is new data in the available ring, and the device needs to perform IO operations. Since IO operations take too long, Linux requires the Hypervisor to submit the IO request to the device and then immediately return the CPU from the Hypervisor to the virtual machine to execute other tasks, improving CPU utilization. Therefore, after the Virtio process completes the IO operation and updates the used ring, it will combine the device's interrupt number irq_id and the virtual machine ID of the device into a device_res structure, add it to the data plane result sub-queue res_list, and fall into the Hypervisor through ioctl and hvc. The data plane result queue res_list is similar to the request submission queue, being a circular queue, with the head index res_front and tail index res_rear determining the queue length. The Hypervisor will retrieve all elements from res_list and add them to the interrupt injection table VIRTIO_IRQS. The interrupt injection table is a key-value pair collection based on a B-tree, where the key is the CPU number, and the value is an array. The first element of the array indicates the valid length of the array, and the subsequent elements indicate the interrupts to be injected into this CPU. To prevent multiple CPUs from simultaneously operating the interrupt injection table, CPUs need to acquire a global mutex lock before accessing the interrupt injection table. Through the interrupt injection table, CPUs can determine which interrupts need to be injected into themselves based on their CPU number. Subsequently, the Hypervisor will send IPI inter-core interrupts to these CPUs needing interrupt injection. CPUs receiving the inter-core interrupts will traverse the interrupt injection table and inject interrupts into themselves. The following diagram describes the entire process, where the black solid triangle arrows represent operations executed by CPUs running other virtual machines, and the black ordinary arrows represent operations executed by CPUs running Root Linux.</p>
<img src="./img/data_plane_queue.svg" alt="data_plane_queue"  />
<ul>
<li>Control Plane Result Sub-queue</li>
</ul>
<p>The control plane result queue, represented by the cfg_values and cfg_flags arrays, uniquely corresponds to the same position of the two arrays for each CPU, i.e., each CPU uniquely corresponds to the same position of the two arrays. cfg_values is used to store the results of control plane interface interactions, and cfg_flags indicate whether the device has completed the control plane interaction request. When the driver program reads and writes the registers of the device memory area (excluding the Queue Notify register), it sends configuration and negotiation-related control plane interaction requests. After such interaction requests are added to the request submission queue, the CPU that falls into the Hypervisor due to the driver needs to wait for the result to return before returning to the virtual machine. Since the Virtio daemon does not need to perform IO operations for these requests, it can quickly complete the request processing and does not need to update the used ring. After completing the request, the daemon will write the result value into cfg_values[id] (for read requests) according to the driver's CPU number id, perform a write memory barrier, then increment cfg_flags[id], and perform a second write memory barrier, ensuring that the driver-side CPU observes the correct result value in cfg_values[id] when observing changes in cfg_flags[id]. When the driver-side CPU observes changes in cfg_flags[id], it can determine that the device has returned the result, directly retrieve the value from cfg_values[id], and return to the virtual machine. This way, the Virtio device can avoid executing ioctl and hvc, causing unnecessary CPU context switches, thereby enhancing the device's performance. The following diagram describes the entire process, where the black solid triangle arrows represent operations executed by CPUs running other virtual machines, and the black ordinary arrows represent operations executed by CPUs running Root Linux.</p>

<p>Since the Virtio daemon located in Root Linux user space needs to communicate with hvisor, this document uses the kernel module hvisor.ko in Root Linux as the communication bridge. In addition to being used by command-line tools, this module also undertakes the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the Virtio device is initialized, it establishes the shared memory area where the communication springboard is located between the Virtio daemon and the Hypervisor.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Virtio daemon is initialized, it requests the kernel module to allocate the shared memory where the communication springboard is located through ioctl. At this time, the kernel module allocates a page of continuous physical memory as shared memory through the memory allocation function <code>__get_free_pages</code> and sets the page attribute to the reserved state through the <code>SetPageReserved</code> function to avoid the page being swapped to disk due to Linux's page recycling mechanism. Subsequently, the kernel module needs to make both the Virtio daemon and the Hypervisor able to access this memory. For the Hypervisor, the kernel module executes hvc to notify the Hypervisor and passes the physical address of the shared memory as a parameter. For the Virtio daemon, the process calls mmap on /dev/hvisor, and the kernel module maps the shared memory to a free virtual memory area of the Virtio process in the hvisor_map function. The starting address of this area is returned as the return value of mmap.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>When the Virtio backend device needs to inject device interrupts into other virtual machines, it notifies the kernel module through ioctl, and the kernel module calls the system interface provided by the Hypervisor through the hvc command to notify the Hypervisor to perform the corresponding operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wake up the Virtio daemon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When the driver accesses the MMIO area of the device, it falls into EL2 and enters the mmio_virtio_handler function. This function determines whether to wake up the Virtio daemon based on the need_wakeup flag in the communication springboard. If the flag is 1, it sends an SGI interrupt with event id IPI_EVENT_WAKEUP_VIRTIO_DEVICE to Root Linux's CPU 0. When CPU 0 receives the SGI interrupt, it falls into EL2 and injects the interrupt number of the hvisor_device node in the Root Linux device tree into itself. When CPU 0 returns to the virtual machine, it receives the interrupt injected into itself and enters the interrupt handling function pre-registered by the kernel service module. This function sends the SIGHVI signal to the Virtio daemon through the send_sig_info function. The Virtio daemon, previously blocked in the sig_wait function, receives the SIGHVI signal, polls the request submission queue, and sets the need_wakeup flag to 0.</p>

<p>To ensure the lightness of the Hypervisor, this document does not adopt the traditional implementation method of Virtio devices in the Hypervisor layer but moves it to the user space of Root Linux as a daemon providing device emulation services. The daemon consists of two parts</p>
