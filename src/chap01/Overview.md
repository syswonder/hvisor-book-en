Welcome to hvisor!

[hvisor](https://github.com/syswonder/hvisor) is a lightweight Type-1 virtual machine monitor written in Rust, offering efficient resource management and low-overhead virtualization performance.

Features
1. **Cross-platform support**: Supports multiple architectures including AARCH64, RISC-V, and LoongArch.
2. **Lightweight**: Focuses on core virtualization features, avoiding unnecessary complexity found in traditional virtualization solutions, suitable for resource-constrained environments.
3. **Efficient**: Runs directly on hardware without going through an OS layer, providing near-native performance.
4. **Security**: Rust is known for its memory safety and concurrent programming model, helping to reduce common system-level programming errors such as memory leaks and data races.
5. **Fast startup**: Designed to be simple with a short startup time, suitable for scenarios that require rapid deployment of virtualization.

Main Functions

1. **Virtual Machine Management**: Provides basic management functions for creating, starting, stopping, and deleting virtual machines.
2. **Resource Allocation and Isolation**: Supports efficient allocation and management of CPU, memory, and I/O devices, using virtualization technology to ensure isolation between different virtual machines, enhancing system security and stability.

Use Cases

1. **Edge Computing**: Suitable for running on edge devices, providing virtualization support for IoT and edge computing scenarios.
2. **Development and Testing**: Developers can quickly create and destroy virtual machine environments for software development and testing.
3. **Security Research**: Provides an isolated environment for security research and malware analysis.
